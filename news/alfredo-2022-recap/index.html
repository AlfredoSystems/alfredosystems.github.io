				2022 was a huge year for MiniFRC and Alfredo Systems! There were many events. There were big events. More MiniFRC robots were built in 2022 than any year since COVID hit, maybe ever! Alfredo was proud to provide field CAD, Field Management Systems, kits of parts, and even full field components for the 2022 events.

				<h5>MiniFRC: Special Edition</h5>

				This event was a strong start for MiniFRC in 2022. Most MiniFRC events have build seasons that last multiple weeks, but for this event it was just a few days! In June the TerrorBytes ran a summer camp for young students and folks with special needs. It was a tremendous success!

				<h5>MiniFRC: Pender County</h5>

				In August teachers at Topsail High School ran their first ever MiniFRC event. This was a milestone event for MiniFRC because it was the first event ever run by an organization other than the TerrorBytes! Very thankful to the folks at Topsail for making it happen.

				<h5>MiniFRC 8: Stronghold</h5>

				Rounding out the year, in December the TerrorBytes held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bab2k9U8nlM&t=11295s">MiniFRC 8: Stronghold</a>! Before this event happened, the most recent mainline event was MiniFRC 6: Deep Space all the way back in 2019. MiniFRC 8 was truly a return to form for MiniFRC. The event was maxed out with 24 teams competing. Attendees packed the awesome new venue for MiniFRC, Raleighâ€™s <a href="https://thefactory.community/">The Factory</a>! This event stands as a shining example of why MiniFRC is a valuable project and the strong community that supports it.
				<br/><br/>
				We are excited to see what teams will do with <a href="https://terrorbytes.org/minifrc-2/minifrc-9-charged-up/">MiniFRC in 2023</a> and beyond!
