				Hello all, welcome to our website! In the interest of keeping this post short I am going to assume anyone reading this post knows what MiniFRC is and a bit of its history. Some of you may remember Alfredo from the 2019 MiniFRC season, when we debuted the Alfredo NoU as our first product. Since then we have been very busy:
				<h5>The website/webstore</h5>
				In-person cash exchanges are a thing of the past. We now have a nice (fully custom) webstore where you can make purchases with PayPal and we can ship anywhere in the US.
				<h5>The NoU2</h5>
				We have developed and will be selling a new custom board, the <a href="/products/alfredo-nou2">Alfredo NoU2</a>! While the first NoU was quite effective, the NoU2 is lightyears ahead in terms of features and quality. You can learn more about it on <a href="/products/alfredo-nou2">its project page</a>, but the highlights are:
				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li>2 more motor ports (for a total of 6)</li>
					<li>Improved power management</li>
					<li>Overall massive build quality increase</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>MiniFRC 7</h5>
				We’re partnering with FIRST Robotics Competition team 4561, the TerrorBytes, to bundle and ship <a href="/products/infinite-recharge-kit-of-parts">kits of parts</a> for MiniFRC: Infinite Recharge. They’ll come standard with a <a href="/products/9v-li-ion-battery">rechargeable 9V Li-ion battery</a>, and teams will have the option to purchase an Uno-based kit for $20.00, or a NoU2-based kit for $25.00.
				
				Speaking of shipping, here’s the plan.
				<ul class="browser-default">
					<li><strong>Saturday, April 25th</strong>: When teams register for MiniFRC, they may reserve a kit of parts of either type. We think our inventory will be large enough to cover all teams, but if we do run out, we’re going to give priority to the teams who reserved their kits first.</li>
					<li><strong>Saturday, May 2nd</strong>: On kickoff, our webstore will open and teams will be able to order kits of parts and any other parts they may want. Over the following days we will begin shipping all orders.</li>
				</ul>
