				<p>Hello all, it's good to be back. We at Alfredo have been working behind the stage over the last few weeks and months to prepare for the summer MiniFRC season. The TerrorBytes have just announced MiniFRC 7.1, a TerrorBytes-only prototype event to pave the way for more public events over the summer. We’ll be providing kits of parts for the event.</p>
				<h5>Shipping Information</h5>
				<p>There are two shipping options for MiniFRC 7.1. Option 1 is our usual method of shipping to your address. Select the <strong>Ground - $5.00</strong> shipping method at checkout and enter your address for this option. Option 2 is shipping straight to the TerrorBytes meetings on 4/27/21 or 5/4/21. If you order more than 6 hours before one of those meetings, select the <strong>Free Shipping - $0.00</strong> shipping method and enter the school's address, your order will be delivered and distributed at that meeting. If you enter an address other than the school’s address and select Free Shipping, we won’t be able to fulfill your order and will get in contact with you. If you’re new to our website, check out our <a href="/products/">products page</a> to purchase a kit of parts and other parts for your robot.</p>
