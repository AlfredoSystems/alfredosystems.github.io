				<p>All PayPal links are now live! You can order your kit of parts (and any other parts you need) effective immediately. We don't expect to run out of stock on any item except for maybe Power Cells, so for now we ask each team to order a maximum of five (including the KoP Power Cell). We’re charging a flat shipping rate of $5.00 for every order.</p>
				<p>If your team is still figuring out what parts you’ll need for your robot, don’t worry, Alfredo won’t begin shipping orders until May 6th. All orders placed before May 5th at midnight will be shipped at the same time. Most of the local orders will be delivered on May 6th, orders from out of the Raleigh/Durham area will be shipped through USPS and will arrive a few days later. Until then, if you decide you want to make a change to an order you’ve already placed, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:alfredopurchases@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alfredopurchases@gmail.com</a>.</p>
